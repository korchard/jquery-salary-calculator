# PROJECT NAME

jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: Approximately 10 hours

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

The application has an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields. Using the stored information, monthly costs are calculated and appended to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background will appear indicating the monthly costs have exceeded the desired amount.

There is a 'Remove' button that deletes an employee from the list of employees and adjusts the total monthly costs to reflect the changes. 

This is an application that takes the input of an employee's name, occupation title, employee identifier, and annual salary and inputs it into a table that calculates the company's total monthly costs. It allows the user to remove people from the list of employees with a button and adjusts the monthly total cost to reflect the changes.

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
