# PROJECT NAME

jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: Approximately 13 hours

The application has an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields. Using the stored information, monthly costs are calculated and appended to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background will appear indicating the monthly costs have exceeded the desired amount.

There is a 'Remove' button that deletes an employee from the list of employees and adjusts the total monthly costs to reflect the changes.
